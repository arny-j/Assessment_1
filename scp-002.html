          SCP-002 is to remain connected to a suitable power supply at all
          times, to keep it in what appears to be a recharging mode. In case
          of electrical outage, the emergency barrier between the object and
          the facility is to be closed and the immediate area evacuated. Once
          facility power is re-established, alternating bursts of X-ray and
          ultraviolet light must strobe the area until SCP-002 is re-affixed
          to the power supply and returned to recharging mode. Containment
          area is to be kept at negative air pressure at all times.
        </p>
        <p>
          Teams including a minimum of two (2) members are required within 20
          meters of SCP-002 or its containment area. Personnel should maintain
          physical contact with one another at all times to confirm there is
          another person present, as perception may be dulled, skewed, or
          influenced by proximity to the object.
        </p>
        <p>
          No personnel below Level 3 are permitted within SCP-002. This
          requirement may be waived via written authorization from two (2)
          off-site Level 4 administrators. Command staff issued such a waiver
          must be escorted by at least five (5) Level 3 Security personnel for
          the duration of their contact and must temporarily surrender their
          rank and security clearance. Following contact, command staff will
          be escorted at least 5 km from SCP-002 to undergo a seventy-two
          (72)-hour quarantine and psychological evaluation. If deemed fit for
          return to duty by psych staff, rank and security clearance may be
          restored when quarantine expires.

          SCP-002 resembles a tumorous, fleshy growth with a volume of
          roughly 60 m³ (or 2000 ft³). An iron valve hatch on one side leads
          to its interior, which appears to be a standard low-rent apartment
          of modest size. One wall of the room possesses a single window,
          though no such opening is visible from the exterior. The room
          contains furniture which, upon close examination, appears to be
          sculpted bone, woven hair, and various other biological substances
          produced by the human body. All matter tested thus far show
          independent or fragmented DNA sequences for each object in the
          room.

        To date, subject has been responsible for the disappearances of seven
        personnel. It has also in its time at the facility further furnished
        itself with two lamps, a throw rug, a television, a radio, a beanbag
        chair, three books in an unknown language, four children's toys, and a
        small potted plant. Tests with a variety of lab animals including
        higher primates have failed to provoke a response in SCP-002. Cadavers
        as well fail to produce any effect. Whatever process the subject uses
        to convert organic matter into furnishings is apparently only
        facilitated by the introduction of living humans.

      <p><code>Mulhausen Report docid:00.023.603</code></p>
      <p>
        <code>The following is a brief report detailing the discovery of
            SCP-002</code>
      </p>
      <p>
        <code>Subject was discovered in a small crater in northern Portugal where
            it struck the Earth from orbit. Encased in a shell of thick rock,
            the fleshy exterior of the object was exposed by the impact. A
            native farmer happened upon the site and reported his findings to
            the village elder. Subject gained SCP attention when a Level 4 agent
            posted in the area detected a small radioactive anomaly generated by
            the object.</code>
      </p>
      <p>
        <code>A collection squad of SCP security personnel led by General
            Mulhausen was immediately dispatched to the area where they quickly
            secured the subject in a large container and performed initial
            testing with subjects recruited from the nearby village. Three men
            individually sent into the structure subsequently disappeared. Upon
            discovering this deadly property of the subject, General Mulhausen
            issued a Level 4a Termination Order of any witnesses (roughly 1/3 of
            the village) to ensure no outside knowledge of the object and
            initiated its transport to SCP facility [DATA EXPUNGED].</code>
      </p>
      <p>
        <code>During preparation for transport, four SCP security personnel were
            inexplicably drawn inside the object where they too immediately
            disappeared. Following inspection, it appeared as if the object had
            "grown" several new furnishings and was beginning to look like the
            interior of an apartment room. General Mulhausen immediately ordered
            the requisition of several Class III HAZMAT suits for the remaining
            security team members, who proceeded to lift the container onto a
            waiting freight ship for transport to the SCP containment
            facility.</code>
      </p>
      <p><code>[DATA EXPUNGED]</code></p>
      <p><code>[DATA EXPUNGED]</code></p>
      <p>
        <code>Following the termination of General Mulhausen, SCP-002 was
            re-secured by SCP staff and brought into special containment in
            [CLASSIFIED], where it currently resides. Staff with clearance below
            Level 3 have been denied access to the SCP-002 container without
            prior approval of at least two Level 4 staff after the Mulhausen
            incident.</code>
