          <p>
            When handling items SCP-004-2 through SCP-004-13, proper procedure
            is vital. The items are not permitted to be moved off-site unless
            accompanied by two Level 4 security personnel. Under no
            circumstances should any other component of SCP-004 be taken through
            SCP-004-1. The effects of doing so are as yet unknown, and the
            current cost of experimentation makes further research impractical.
            Should any of the objects contained within SCP-004-1 breach
            containment, or the facility be breached, the keys must be brought
            inside and the door closed prior to activation of Site 62's on-site
            warhead. Unauthorized removal of keys from the testing area is
            grounds for immediate termination.
          </p>
          <p>
            Level 1 clearance is required for basic access to SCP-004-1; Level 4
            clearance is required for use of SCP-004-2 to -13.

            According to their testimony, they found a set of rusted keys in an
            iron lockbox and determined what door the keys unlock. The juveniles
            are taken into custody after they contact Sheriff █████████████████
            when one of their friends (SCP-004-CAS01) goes missing.

            tell authorities that upon opening the door with one of the keys,

            disappeared. At this point, the SCP Foundation takes over the

            SCP-004-2 through SCP-004-13 all fit into a single lock on the large
            barred door. 12 Class D personnel are assigned to test the effects
            of the door. Of the twelve test subjects each trying a different key
            to enter the room, only two survive. Opening the door with any key
            except SCP-004-7 or SCP-004-12 caused the test subjects to be torn
            apart in multiple directions; however, no dismembered parts were
            found until later. At the time of writing, only two parts of each
            subject have been recovered (with the exception of the subject using
            SCP-004-█, whose pieces were scattered in close proximity). The
            others have, for all intents and purposes, vanished from existence.

            Of the two surviving subjects, only one (having used SCP-004-7)
            returned unharmed. The other came back in a near-catatonic state,
            able only to remove himself from the room and then collapse on the
            floor, and had to be restrained to prevent him from gouging out his
            eyes (see Appendix A: Mental Health Effects of SCP-004). The subject
            using SCP-004-7 said that he had entered a large room, impossibly
            big for the size of the attached building. After his exit, SCP-004-1
            was propped open and an armed squad of Level 3 personnel entered.
            The size of the room is impossible to measure and the door frame and
            the individuals in the room are the only part of the room that can
            be felt or illuminated.

            SCP-004 seems to propagate spatiotemporal anomalies. Personnel
            leaving the facility report losing time. Those who have been in the
            site for weeks insist that they had only been in the facility for
            several days, and records of work completed and supplies consumed
            support their claims. Other temporal anomalies involve SCP-004-2
            through -13, especially the reappearance of SCP-004-CAS01 and
            SCP-004-CAS02 exactly ██ years after using SCP-004-██.
            ████████████████████ has been assigned to investigate all aspects of
            these time anomalies. Spatial anomalies include the impossibly large
            dimensions of the area opened by SCP-004-7. Similarly, the 2003
            blackout incident suggests that there exists an alternate plane of
            existence within the same space that Site-62 occupies.

                  All Class D personnel using SCP-004-12 return in a catatonic
                  state, unable to speak. Some may have enough energy left to
                  try to claw out their eyes. Of the 16 subjects, only 4 have
                  survived. Only one has regained speech, following long-term
                  psychotherapy. He was able to tell the psychiatrist that he
                  saw a massive green creature, so large that much of its body
                  extended beyond his field of view. He reported innate fear and
                  sudden recognition, “as if it were something buried deep in
                  [his] primal fears,” and forced implantation of
                  “incomprehensible” memories. Subject displays acute
                  anterograde and retrograde amnesia.

              <p><b>Item #:</b> SCP-004-14 SCP-004-14</p>
              <p><b>Date of Discovery:</b> 09/02/1950</p>
              <p>
                <b>Origin of Object:</b> Object was discovered elsewhere in
                factory area, in the previously undiscovered manager's office.
              </p>
              <p>
                <b>Description:</b> Object appears as a large, unvarnished
                wooden box. The box may be unlocked by the "safe" key,
                SCP-004-7, as well as five of the "unsafe" keys (see Document
                SCP-004-1).
              </p>
              <p>
                Upon unlocking SCP-004-14 with SCP-004-7, the box opens
                automatically on hinges. The volume of the space inside is
                precisely five times greater than the outer dimensions imply.
                Items placed within while the lid remains open do not affect the
                weight or any other properties of the box. When the lid is
                closed and locked, however, all items inside vanish
                irretrievably. Personnel locked inside the box are also
                irretrievable, although losing personnel in this fashion appears
                to affect significantly the dreams experienced by [DATA
                EXPUNGED].
