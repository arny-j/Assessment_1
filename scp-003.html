            SCP-003 is to be maintained at a constant temperature of no less
            than 35°C and ideally kept above 100°C. No living multicellular
            organisms of Category IV or higher complexity may be allowed to come
            into contact with SCP-003.
          </p>
          <p>
            In event of total power failure, if SCP-003-1 begins to increase its
            mass, assigned personnel must engage in skin contact with SCP-003-1.
            Ideally, personnel may use their body heat to return SCP-003-1 to
            above the critical temperature; however, skin contact must be
            maintained even in event of SCP-003 reaching activation temperature,
            lasting at minimum until SCP-003-1 advances fully to its second
            growth stage.
          </p>
          <p>
            Personnel who enter SCP-003's containment area must first be
            examined for body parasites of Category IV or higher complexity, and
            sterilized if such organisms are present. All personnel who have
            come in physical contact with SCP-003-1 are to immediately report
            for sterilization afterwards.
          </p>
          <p>
            SCP-003-1 must not be removed from SCP-003-2 except in case of
            emergency procedures detailed above. Any significant change in
            SCP-003-2's rune activity (including pattern, frequency, or color)
            should be reported within three (3) hours of occurrence. Cessation
            of rune activity must be reported immediately. SCP-003-2 must be
            supplied with power via the source designated Generator 003-IX at
            all times.

            SCP-003 consists of two related components of separate origin,
            referred to as SCP-003-1 and SCP-003-2.
          </p>
          <p>
            SCP-003-1 appears to be composed of chitin, hair, and nails of
            unknown biology, arranged in a configuration similar to that of a
            computer motherboard. Testing reveals SCP-003-1 to predate earliest
            known circuit boards by a factor of thousands of years. SCP-003-1 is
            considered sentient but not actively dangerous except under certain
            conditions.
          </p>
          <p>
            SCP-003-1 was found on a stone tablet, SCP-003-2, on which it
            currently resides. The runes on SCP-003-2 are not part of any known
            language, and emit pale, flickering light patterns.
          </p>
          <p>
            SCP-003-2 is controlled by a (non-biological) internal computer, the
            contents of which are mostly inaccessible without risk of damaging
            SCP-003-2. SCP-003-2 is capable of controlled emissions of
            radiation, including heat, light, and anomalous radiation types.
            SCP-003-2 contains an internal power source of an anomalous nature,
            which appears to have been losing power since several centuries
            before discovery.

      <p>
        It is considered probable that SCP-003-2 was created for the purpose of
        containing SCP-003-1. Partially interpreted data recovered from
        SCP-003-2 may refer to a past and/or potential future LK-class
        restructuring event caused by SCP-003-1.
      </p>
      <p>
        SCP-003 was located by remote viewing team SRV-04 Beta. It appears
        possible that SRV-04 Beta was deliberately contacted by SCP-003-2. Other
        organizations have also been alerted to SCP-003's existence, possibly by
        similar means. Despite this activity, SCP-003-2 does not appear to be
        sentient, based on its lack of reaction to M03-Gloria analysis and
        procedures.
      </p>
      <p>
        When SCP-003 drops below the temperature of 35°C, both components react.
      </p>
      <p>
        First, SCP-003-1 enters a growth state characterized by an exponential
        increase in mass. This growth state consists of two stages. In both
        stages, SCP-003-1 partially fuels its growth by converting matter around
        it, starting with any surrounding inorganic material, including
        atmospheric elements, then nonliving organic material, including cells
        of dead skin, hair, chitin, enamel, keratin, and other biological
        materials.
      </p>
      <p>
        The first stage is always the same. SCP-003-1 will first increase its
        mass, then take a form similar in shape to an ophiuroid (brittle star)
        of fifteen meters in diameter (including what appears to be a central
        processor of three meters in diameter). It will form sensory organs that
        appear to scan its surrounding environment, and will partially convert
        the area around it to an unidentified anomalous substance (SCP-003-2
        seems immune from conversion).
      </p>
      <p>
        The second stage describes a growth alteration which occurs when SCP-003
        comes into contact with living organic material; SCP-003 appears to
        "template" itself off of the organic material, and will attempt
        communication with organisms that match its initial "template" or
        "templates".
      </p>
      <p>
        In its second stage, SCP-003-1 may pause, slow or change its growth, and
        will also convert inorganic and nonliving organic elements into
        functionally similar structures while anomalously altering their
        physical makeup.
      </p>
      <p>
        While growth is consistent in the first stage, in the second stage
        SCP-003-1's growth rate is diminished by 20-90% so long as SCP-003-1
        remains in contact with living organic material. The percentage is
        determined by the complexity of the organism(s) in contact with
        SCP-003-1; SCP-003-1 appears to devote a large amount of processing
        power to analysis of living organic material.
      </p>
      <p>
        During each of SCP-003-1's growth stages, SCP-003-2 releases bursts of
        radiation that temporarily inhibit SCP-003-1's growth, or reverse this
        growth when the temperature of SCP-003-1 rises above 100°C. Similar
        radiation emissions have been replicated or recorded via other anomalous
        means.
      </p>
      <p>
        SCP-003-1's biology has been the subject of extensive study. Significant
        elements have been identified similar to SCP-███, SCP-1512, and
        SCP-2756, the latter two of which have no further confirmed connection
        with SCP-003-1 and no known connection with each other, and none of
        which are fully understood (technically, even less understood than
        SCP-003, thanks to the extensive cross-disciplinary research on the
        SCP-003 objects). To date, no convincing analysis has been put forward
        which satisfactorily explains SCP-003-1's connection to these SCP
        objects or others, nor its connection to modern technology beyond
        appearance (and potential mimicry via unknown mechanism).

                  [DATA EXPUNGED] for analysis of functions. SCP-003-1 must now
                  be considered sentient, and is to be kept a minimum of 1 km
                  from [DATA EXPUNGED] and the resulting "by-product" at all

                  During M03-Gloria procedures, SCP-003-1 doubled its mass and
                  began rapid structural growth. Temperature was immediately
                  returned to 100°C. Growth and mass increase of SCP-003-1
                  continued for 9 minutes and 6 seconds, at which time a
                  sustained radiation spike was produced by SCP-003-2. In
                  response, SCP-003-1 returned to its normal state in 3 minutes
                  and 39 seconds. New growth dissolved into a dusty residue
                  which was collected for analysis. Both SCP-003-1 and SCP-003-2
                  ceased all detectable activity. SCP-003-2 did not resume
                  activity until connected to external power source. SCP-003-2's
                  runes glowed uniformly gray and did not resume normal activity
                  for three (3) hours. SCP-003-2 no longer appears to be able to
                  maintain containment area at a temperature above 35°C without
                  external power supplied by Generators 003-III through IX.

                  The procedure detailed in Addendum 003-03 was repeated, and
                  SCP-003-1 again entered a growth state. After 10 minutes and
                  13 seconds, SCP-003-2 once again produced a sustained
                  radiation spike. SCP-003-1's growth stopped for 36 seconds,
                  then resumed at its previous pace.
                </p>
                <p>
                  On quadrupling its mass, SCP-003-1 formed a coherent outer
                  shell and body. After appearing to scan its environment and
                  partially converting its environment, SCP-003-1 then breached
                  containment, entering the observation gallery where nine
                  members of M03-Gloria were present. On physical contact with
                  team members, SCP-003-1 encompassed them in rapidly-grown
                  appendages and stopped growth for 15 minutes. SCP-003-1 then
                  resumed growth, and rearranged the component parts of the
                  center of its form to the shape of a three-meter-tall female
                  humanoid, with peripheral "tentacles" shifting to extrude
                  primarily from SCP-003-1's newly formed "hair" and spine.
                  SCP-003-1 then produced rudimentary vocalizations in an
                  apparent initial attempt to communicate with researchers.

                  An unknown individual approached the compromised containment
                  area in company of a full squad of agents. The individual
                  claimed to be acting on orders of O5-10 and attempted
                  communication with SCP-003-1. [DATA EXPUNGED]
                </p>
                <p>
                  Following this incident, Agent Jackson of M03-Gloria
                  successfully restored power to SCP-003-2 and activated backup
                  generators to return the temperature to 100°C. SCP-003-1
                  returned to its normal state in 21 minutes and 7 seconds, and
                  was successfully re-contained without incident.
                </p>
                <p>
                  All nine members of M03-Gloria affected by SCP-003-1 were
                  afterwards found to be physically unharmed, with no residual
                  effects besides psychological trauma. The converted materials
                  of SCP-003's former containment area did not dissolve and are
                  now under analysis.
